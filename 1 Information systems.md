### Information Systems Overview

**Information Systems** are the backbone of modern businesses, integrating technology, people, and processes to support decision-making, coordination, and analysis. They play a vital role in scenarios like inventory management, customer behavior analysis, and financial reporting. Below is a summary of key components and examples:

---

### **1. Use Cases and Relevant Information**

- **Inventory Management**:
    
    - **Example**: Tracking products that need restocking.
    - **Data Used**: Product inventory levels and restocking thresholds.
    - **Outcome**: Optimized stock levels to avoid overstocking or shortages.
- **Customer Analytics**:
    
    - **Example**: Analyzing purchasing trends for marketing strategies.
    - **Data Used**: Purchase history, demographics, and behavior patterns.
    - **Outcome**: Improved targeted marketing and customer satisfaction.
- **Financial Reporting**:
    
    - **Example**: Creating revenue reports for stakeholders.

### **2. Components of an Information System**

1. **Backend (Databases)**:
    
    - Stores raw data such as products, orders, and customer details.
    - Enables structured data retrieval via SQL or APIs.
2. **Middleware (Business Logic)**:
    
    - Contains rules for processing transactions, such as validating payments or updating stock after a sale.
    - Often implemented as services (e.g., REST APIs).
3. **Frontend (User Interface)**:
    
    - The interface users interact with, such as dashboards for admins or shopping portals for customers.
    - Ensures usability and accessibility.
